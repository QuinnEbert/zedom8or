Miscellaneous Toys
------------------

This directory contains the following odds and ends:

`TelnetCS.c` is a single-command Telnet command sending utility, based on code by CMU (tweaked for sending commands to VSX-1022-K, et al). *Ultimate intent is to be used with a future utility that monitors PCM input from a microphone in your theatre space that can then be acted upon to nudge the volume levels up and down on the VSX-1022-K to try to keep the volume levels comfortable.*
`ZedHears` is (currently only beginnings of) a Mac OS X utility to record from an audio input device.  This will eventually get crammed together with **TelnetCS.c** for various forms of general mayhem.
`zedom8or-ipad` is a Cordova-based shim that hooks into your web based iPad remote UI and presents the UI to you as an iPad app.  *Replacing the splash screen I included is probably a cool idea!* :-P
