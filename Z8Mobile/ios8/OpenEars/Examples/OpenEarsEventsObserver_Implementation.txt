Add the following to your implementation (the .m file):

Under the @implementation keyword at the top:
<pre>
@synthesize openEarsEventsObserver;
</pre>

Among the other methods of the class, add this lazy accessor method for confident memory management of the object:

<pre>
- (OpenEarsEventsObserver *)openEarsEventsObserver {
	if (openEarsEventsObserver == nil) {
		openEarsEventsObserver = [[OpenEarsEventsObserver alloc] init];
	}
	return openEarsEventsObserver;
}
</pre>

and then right before you start your first OpenEars functionality (for instance, right before your first self.fliteController say:withVoice: message or right before your first self.pocketsphinxController startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath:dictionaryAtPath:languageModelIsJSGF: message) send this message:

<pre>
[self.openEarsEventsObserver setDelegate:self];
</pre>
