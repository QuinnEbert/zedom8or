<p>To use FliteController, you need to have at least one Flite voice added to your project. When you added the "framework" folder of OpenEars to your app, you already imported a voice called Slt, so these instructions will use the Slt voice. You can get eight more free voices in OpenEarsExtras, available at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Politepix/openearsextras">https://bitbucket.org/Politepix/openearsextras</a></p>
