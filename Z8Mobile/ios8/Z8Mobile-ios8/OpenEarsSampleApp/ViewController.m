// IMPORTANT NOTE: This version of OpenEars introduces a much-improved low-latency audio driver for recognition. However, it is no longer compatible with the Simulator.
// Because I understand that it can be very frustrating to not be able to debug application logic in the Simulator, I have provided a second driver that is based on
// Audio Queue Services instead of Audio Units for use with the Simulator exclusively. However, this is purely provided as a convenience for you: please do not evaluate
// OpenEars' recognition quality based on the Simulator because it is better on the device, and please do not report Simulator-only bugs since I only actively support 
// the device driver and generally, audio code should never be seriously debugged on the Simulator since it is just hosting your own desktop audio devices. Thanks!

#pragma mark Example for reading out Pocketsphinx and Flite audio levels without locking the UI by using an NSTimer

// What follows are not OpenEars methods, just an approach for level reading
// that I've included with this sample app. My example implementation does make use of two OpenEars
// methods:	the pocketsphinxInputLevel method of PocketsphinxController and the fliteOutputLevel
// method of fliteController. 
//
// The example is meant to show one way that you can read those levels continuously without locking the UI, 
// by using an NSTimer, but the OpenEars level-reading methods 
// themselves do not include multithreading code since I believe that you will want to design your own 
// code approaches for level display that are tightly-integrated with your interaction design and the  
// graphics API you choose. 
// 
// Please note that if you use my sample approach, you should pay attention to the way that the timer is always stopped in
// dealloc. This should prevent you from having any difficulties with deallocating a class due to a running NSTimer process.
