zedom8or: reasonable-cost theatre automation!
========

Using a combination of [PioneerRebel](https://github.com/QuinnEbert/PioneerRebel "PioneerRebel") *(and a compatible receiver)*, [USB-UIRT](http://www.usbuirt.com "USB-UIRT"), and [LIRC](http://www.lirc.org "LIRC"), **zedom8or** aims to produce a low-effort, reasonable-cost single-room (for now) home theatre automation package.

Plans
-----

* Web-based interface for control.
* ***Tested on Raspberry Pi as a primary platform.***
* 3D-printable (tested on Solidoodle 2) STL model files for printable cases that can be used to better situate and arrange your R-Pi and/or USB-UIRT.

Status
------

* *Awaiting my USB-UIRT to begin tinkering.*
