zedom8or: reasonable-cost theatre automation!
========

Using a combination of [PioneerRebel](https://github.com/QuinnEbert/PioneerRebel "PioneerRebel") *(and a compatible receiver)*, [USB-UIRT](http://www.usbuirt.com "USB-UIRT"), and [LIRC](http://www.lirc.org "LIRC"), **zedom8or** aims to produce a low-effort, reasonable-cost single-room (for now) home theatre automation package.

Highlights
----------

+ Will be primarily tested on Raspberry Pi (Model B), *assuring a high-quality experience on the ultra-low-profile platform*.
+ Will have web-based user interfaces highly optimized for many highly-popular smartphones, tablets, and the Nintendo Wii-U tablet (to name a few)!

Roadmap
-------

*Not listed in any particular order...*

+ To be listed, ASAP.
